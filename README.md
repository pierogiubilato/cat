# CAT - C++ Acquisition & Analysis Toolset

---
# Overview
CAT simplifies the interface development for data acquisition applications workflows. It provides a simple, variable-based GUI creation mechanism and a 2D/3D visualiztion and interaction system.
CAT uses a server-client mechanism, where the client is the user application, and the server is a standalone CAT application which handles all the user interaction. This way, the client-side development requires minimal libraries and coding, while the actual interface may run in a different machine or even system, and interact with several clients at the same time.
